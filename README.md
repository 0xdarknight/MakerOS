Maker MCP: Notion to Figma to Vercel
A Model Context Protocol integration created for the ADK-TS Hackathon 2025, connecting Notion, Figma and Vercel into one AI workflow.

The ADK-TS Hackathon 2025 is a 4-week global online competition hosted by IQ AI, bringing together developers and innovators to push the boundaries of AI agents using the ADK-TS framework : a toolkit for building, extending and deploying AI agents and integrations.
Maker MCP is our entry for the MCP Expansion Track, showing how ADK-TS and the Model Context Protocol can bridge creative tools and deployment platforms.

This MCP makes AI agents:
* Read structured content from Notion pages and databases
* Generate or update designs in Figma based on that content
* Automatically deploy updates to Vercel — creating a full “content → design → deploy” automation loop
